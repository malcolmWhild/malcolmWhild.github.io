            <h1>Data Processing</h1>
            <p>
              Coming from a pre-press/graphic design background, databases and associated technologies has been an exciting step in a new
              direction for me. I find that it appeals to the logical side of my nature, and it is very rewarding to program
              queries that will clean and process large amounts of data very quickly.
            </p>
            <p>When any of the elements of a DM campaign are to be mailed, the first step is to clean the data so that it complies
              with NZ Post standards. I import supplied data files into Access where I merge then if necessary and add standard
              DM fields. I populate the DM fields using using SQL queries which I order and save in case the data is resupplied
              for any reason. The queries perform tasks such as splitting addresses on commas, checking/flagging overseas
              records, extracting postcodes, de-duping, processing for SOA, mailcasing, flagging GNA records, splitting out
              into runs/batches and postcode sorting. Access is a good tool, but for large databases I would prefer to use
              the power of SQL Server. With this in mind, I'm working towards using C# to create a data processing application
              which will interface directly with SQL Server and guide the user through the steps necessary to import and
              standardise data.

        <h2>Indesign page layout</h2>
        I can lay out any type of digital or print artwork quickly, accurately and to budget. I ensure consistency, especially in
        complex layouts, and I have an experienced eye for spelling and grammar. I love using Indesign and the Creative Suite,
        and enjoy using my experience to produce great-looking artwork.
        <h3>Point of sale and advertising</h3>
        I have experience in producing marketing and publicity material for publishers, using Photoshop for image merging, masking
        and adjustment, and HTML and CSS for web-based advertising.
        <h3>Mac systems maintenance and troubleshooting</h3>
        Ensuring the smooth running of a Mac network requires organised and efficient working practices. I have experience of font
        and application troubleshooting, as well as hardware setup and maintenance.
        <h3>Pre-press and digital</h3>
        I have plenty of experience in the commercial pre-press and digital environments, a mature and reliable work ethic, and a
        passion for producing great books in a collaborative working environment. Dear Sir or Madam, I’m writing in response
        to your advertisement for a technical documents graphic designer. I am experienced in the production of technical
        documentation – many of the publications that I have produced have been educational and scientific – so I am used
        to dealing with complex layouts. I am enthusiastic about producing functional, well-organised and documented print-ready
        files, and I have good experience in managing workflow. I’m used to dealing with supplied files and with templates,
        so I’m able to quickly understand the structure of existing documents. Along with a mature and reliable work ethic,
        I have excellent written and verbal English, so I’m able to work effectively in a team by building and maintaining
        good relationships. I can bring an experienced eye for spelling, grammar and layout, I respond well to ideas and
        feedback, and am always keen to learn new techniques. I have plenty of layout experience to deadlines and strong
        pre-press and Mac troubleshooting skills.
        <h1>Key strengths</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Indesign page layout – academic / books / catalogues </li>
          <li>Photoshop image manipulation / clear-cutting</li>

          <li>Flash</li>
          <li>Microsoft Office</li>
        </ul>
        I have a good understanding of the difference between designing for print and for web, of image resolution and of HTML and
        CSS.
        <h1>Personal Qualities</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Reliable and punctual</li>
          <li>Good communicator</li>
          <li>Able to build good relationships</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>General information</h4>
        I’m reliable, and I take the opportunity to learn new skills whenever possible. I’m able to communicate effectively with
        all stakeholders, and I have a positive and cheerful nature. I take the time to listen to others, and find it easy
        to work either in a team or autonomously. I can offer over 30 years’ experience of working in a commercial prepress
        environment, and I can provide personal and professional references.
