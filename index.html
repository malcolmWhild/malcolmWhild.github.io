          I have three years’ experience using Access, SQL Server, and XMPie, along with Litmus, Dreamweaver and InDesign to produce
          a range of digital and print communications. I also use Campaign Monitor for eDM and Modica for SMS campaigns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along with a mature and reliable work ethic, I have excellent communication skills, and am able to work effectively in a
          team by building and maintaining good relationships. I have a positive and cheerful disposition and I enjoy sharing
          knowledge and creating documentation to help standardise working practices.

        <p>
          Because I come from a pre-press/graphic design background, databases and associated technologies has been an exciting step
          in a new direction for me. I find that it appeals to the logical side of my nature, and it is very rewarding to
          program queries that will clean and process large amounts of data very quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          When any of the elements of a DM campaign are to be mailed, the first step is to clean the data so that it complies with
          NZ Post standards. Data processing is done in Access using SQL queries which perform tasks such as checking/flagging
          overseas records, extracting postcodes, de-duping, processing for SOA, mailcasing, flagging GNA records, splitting
          out into runs/batches and postcode sorting.

          I have many years' experience using Indesign and I am enthusiastic about producing functional, well-organised and documented
          print-ready files. I’m used to dealing with supplied files and with templates, so I’m able to quickly understand
          the structure of existing documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Supplied Indesign files are checked to ensure that there is sufficient bleed, fonts and images are properly supplied and
          that all images are checked and resized if necessary to optimise performance of generated PDFs through the RIP.
        </p>
        <p>
          The processed data is used to create a plan file and any campaign logic is added in uPlan, including ADORs for text placeholders,
          layer visibility, and barcodes. QLingo logic is used extensively, while Javascript is also used for string manipulation.

          I use Campaign Monitor for stand-alone eDM campaigns. Campaign Monitor is a quick and efficient tool with good reporting.
          I have good experience in using logic to create segments to further target recipients or to control the visibility
          of targeted content, and I am confident in managing lists and client accounts.

        <p>
          I use Modica for SMS campaigns. As with Campaign Monitor, I am experienced in creating lists and managing client accounts.

        </a>Multi-channel Campaigns</h3>
        <p>
          Multi-channel campaigns are the part of the work that I look forward to most. It is very rewarding to be able to create a
          smooth-running multi-channel campaign and to be able to track recipient engagement in real time.
        </p>
        <p>This type of work appeals to the logical side of my nature and has been a very satisfying addition to my more traditional
          pre-press experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the constantly evolving methods of communication, it is exciting to be involved at the forefront of developments in
          utilising clients’ data to effectively target their customer base.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there is a print component to the campaign, data is processed in Access and any campaign-specific fields are added, then
          the working table is imported directly into SQL Server and linked to a uPlan file with write-enabled ADORs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the plan file and data source are uploaded to the uProduce server, web pages are created in Visual Studio Code. Campaign
          emails are coded in Litmus and then inlined and imported to Dreamweaver for ADORs to be placed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Campaign reports are created using the uProduce Marketing Console and are linked to a Circle plan so that the client can
          track email opens, page visits and completion rates along with other valuable information to help them determine
          the success of their campaign.
